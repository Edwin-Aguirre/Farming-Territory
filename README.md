In this exciting 1v1 game, you and your opponent compete to cultivate a small farm where you can plant five different types of vegetables. Each vegetable goes through three growth cycles, and once it reaches the third cycle, itâ€™s ready for harvest. Each type has its own growth time and payout, adding a strategic layer to your farming decisions.

To boost your earnings, you can purchase one of five different farm animals, each providing a multiplier on the money you earn from your crops. Your ultimate goal? Acquire as many vacant plots of land as possible before your opponent does. Get ready for a thrilling battle of strategy and skill!
